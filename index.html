      -----------------------------------------------------------------------
       Safe to import in *any* environment (browser, Node test‚Äërunner, etc.)
       No external network calls ‚Äì¬†icons & fonts are local / data‚ÄëURIs
       DOM logic executes *only* when `document` is available (prevents the
        ChromeTransport / headless launch error seen in sandbox tests).
       Added basic self‚Äëtests to verify data structure at runtime.
